                <p>No one said it would be easy taking a family of 9 on a thousand mile journey...</p>
                <p>We should have known when it took forever to get loaded at Kristina's house</p>
                <p>Finally, 1 1/2 hrs and 2 car loads later we were on our way</p>
                <p>Day one got us about 450 miles to Bellville, OH. Not too bad...</p>
                <p>Finally day 2 got us there about 8:30 pm. Pretty consistent at another 450 miles.</p>

                <h2 class="leads">Time To Head Home</h2>
                <p>It's always hard to leave and this was no exception.</p>
                <p>We finally left about noon on Sunday, Aug 14th</p>
                <p>We had plans to stop at Niagara Falls, but decided not too since it was so late.</p>
                <p>Made it to Cleveland on day 1 of driving.</p>
                <p>Finally home at 11pm on Monday! Nothing like stopping for an hour every 3-4 hrs to feed a baby!</p>
